# Original guidance from Obsidian development team was "Don't include the
# compiled 'main.js' file in the repo. They should be uploaded to GitHub
# releases instead." This is good guidance in general and in this template
# we have decided to include the generated file in the repository. Some
# benefits with this approach:
#
#   - Allows for a more seamless experience for users who want to clone the
#     repository and start working on the plugin right away.
#   - Allows for clear comparison of changes between releases. This is why
#     we do not minify the release by default.
